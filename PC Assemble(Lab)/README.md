<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>The lab session on PC assembly was quite interesting and fun  because we got hands-on experience.Guided from technician that made us easy to do as team.Based on my knowledge,I personally physically connect the motherboard to RAM,storage devices and CPU.</p>
<p>In the lab session,we also got trobleshooting minor issues such as cable and component connections.We get to know that some of the component were sensitive to human touch.</p>
<p>The session also need the precision and attention  to detail when assembly the PC.Handling properly some of the components as precautions for electronic devices care.</p>
<p>Moreover, collaborating with team during the lab need a skills of teamwork. We discussing different opinions and thoughts to assembly the PC are challenges that us need to encounter.</p>
<p>Overall, the PC assembly lab was a practical exercise for me as computer science student.This lab session give me insight about the different between  theoretical knowledge and practical application. It also increased my confidence when handling hardware.</p>
