<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>Dr. Seah’s ability to use his IT expertise to advance social well-being inspired me. I’ve been inspired by the discussion to consider the ways in which technology might be used to solve global concerns and provide meaningful solutions.</p>
<p>These days, technology advancement for other sector is crucial to boost production. From my view, with the population that increased, technology played the main role to control the sector to serve the community. I gained valuable insight from this talk that I-Farm is good way and give beneficial impact to community and sellers. Traditional agriculture might good for right now but in future we need to be prepared for population increased of humanity. I-Farm has provided me with excellent exposure to the ways in which technological advancements potentially enhance certain aspects of human existence.</p>
